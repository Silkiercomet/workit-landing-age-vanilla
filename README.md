### What I learned
the background images only exist in the container they're defined in (stacking context), this means that even if said container has the overflow property declared, the background image is never gonna overflow his parent because is the only context for which it exist, that said if his parent is overflowing his container the image is gonna show outside said container


```html
        <div class="invitation__content">
            <h2>Be the first to test</h2>

```
```css
.invitation__content {
  overflow-y: visible;
  max-width: 75%;
  margin-left: auto;
  align-items: flex-start;
  padding: 40px 65px;
  gap: 25px;
  text-align: left;


}
.invitation__content::after{
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  bottom: -85px;
  right: 0px;
  min-height: 220px;
  min-width: 220px;

  background-color: transparent;
  background-image: url(images/bg-pattern-3.svg);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: cover;
  background-position: center;
}
```


### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.


### Useful resources

- [stacking context resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context) - This helped me for to crete the overflow effect in the invitation section.
